          <p>My name is <strong>Jason Huels</strong>. I am an aspiring programmer, bedroom-musician, and video game enthusiast.
          I was born in Vermont in 1987, I spent most of my formative years in Central California, and moved to Portland, OR
          in 2008. I currently live in North Portland with girlfriend Rosie and our shih-tzu Bridget (pictured).</p>

          <p>I enrolled at Epicodus in order to increase my programming knowledge-base and add tech experience to
          my resume. I'm excited to brush-up my JavaScript skills and learn another programming language. I chose Epicodus
          over other coding bootcamps due to their <span class="make-red"><em>emphasis</em> on pair programming</span>
          and the opportunity to intern at a tech company.</p>

          <h1>Interests</h1>
          <h2>Programming</h2>
          <p>I am interested in a career in programming because it is something I enjoy!
          I first discovered my interest in programming by making small video game projects in
          Game Maker Studio. I have taken classes in multiple programming languages and so far I have
          enjoyed Java more than any other language.</p>

          <h2>Music</h2>
          <p>I listen to music constantly during my down time, while driving, and often while working.
          I like many genres of music, but primarily listen to rock 'n' roll.</p>
          <p>I also play multiple instruments (listed in order of competency):</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Guitar</li>
            <li>Bass</li>
            <li>Keyboards</li>
            <li>Mandolin</li>
            <li>Drums</li>
            <li>Melodica</li>
            <li>Harmonica</li>
            <li>Banjo</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Video Games</h2>
          <p>I've loved video games since I was 5 years old and my interest has <strong>not</strong> faded over time.
          I prefer 2D platformer and adventure games more than most modern 3D games. My <em>favorite</em> video game of
          all time is Spelunky.</p>
